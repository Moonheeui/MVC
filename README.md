# MVC

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It divides an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.

MVC helps in separating the concerns of an application, making it easier to manage, test, and modify individual components without affecting the others.
